The previous AI engineer successfully initiated the frontend development for La Coral website, focusing on a visually stunning and high-converting design. The work followed a premium design framework, incorporating sophisticated UI/UX principles, a specific color strategy (black and maroon), and modern typography. The engineer established a robust React-based architecture with TailwindCSS for styling and leveraged Framer Motion and GSAP for animations, ensuring a dynamic user experience. All required content sections, from Historia to Zona de Socios, were systematically translated into dedicated React components. The process involved initial dependency installation, image procurement via , and sequential component creation, culminating in the assembly of a . The last action involved fixing a minor import error and restarting services, with the immediate next step being comprehensive testing. The engineer prioritized efficiency and a modular approach, setting up a clear foundation for future development.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a professional website for La Coral Tierras Altas de Sanabria y Carballeda to establish an online presence. The website needs to feature detailed sections including: La Coral: Historia, Una agrupación especial, Repertorio, Contrátanos, Ciclos de conciertos, Próximas actuaciones, Escuela de Música, ¡Únete a la Coral!, and Zona de socios. A key functional requirement is an online Contrátanos (hire/book) feature, where initial reservations are submitted online but require manual review and formalization by a person.

Design-wise, the site must align with a choir aesthetic, specifically incorporating black and maroon colors inspired by the choir's attire. The development adheres to a premium design framework emphasizing: dramatic visual atmosphere with color contrast, glass-morphism effects, subtle shadows, rounded corners, layered design, hover animations, gradient overlays, responsive design, parallax scrolling, and grid textures. Typography needs to be premium with dramatic scale contrasts and varied weights. Imagery is crucial, sourced via , for sections like the Hero, History, Concerts, Music School, and general performance. The user explicitly approved a React-based implementation if WordPress was not feasible.
